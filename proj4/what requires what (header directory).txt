uses item.h -> weapon.h, ship.h, engine.h, armor.h
uses ship.h -> planet.h
uses planet.h -> mining.h,gas.h, enemy.h,

game.h uses all of the above
proj4.cpp uses game.h



what needs to be done:
	- randomly select an item of value that is equal to the planets challenge (IdentifyItem();)

office hours questions:
	mem leaks issues:
		- new should only be in loaditems or load planets or ship creation
